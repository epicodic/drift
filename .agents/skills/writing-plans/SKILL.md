# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure - but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Run coding-guideline follow-up checklist for this task" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use skills:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or skills:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, JavaScript, and QML with npm; optional Python with uv, pytest, Ruff, and ty.

**Coding Conventions:** `docs/coding-conventions.md` — read before implementing

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test_component.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# Python — full type annotations required
def test_specific_behavior() -> None:
    result = function(input_value)
    assert result == expected
```

```cpp
// C++ (GoogleTest) — CamelCase for both suite and case
TEST(ComponentTest, SpecificBehavior)
{
    EXPECT_EQ(function(input_value), expected);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

TypeScript/JavaScript/QML: `npm test`
Python: `uv run pytest tests/path/test_component.py::test_specific_behavior -v`
Expected: FAIL — feature not yet implemented

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(value: InputType) -> OutputType:
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

`npm test` or `uv run pytest tests/path/test_component.py -v`, as appropriate for the changed language
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Coding-guideline follow-up checklist (mandatory before task completion)**

Run this checklist and record PASS/FAIL with file evidence:
- [ ] Conventions file read for touched language(s):
    `docs/coding-conventions.md`
- [ ] Naming conventions match project rules for all new/edited symbols
- [ ] Language-specific guidelines are followed
- [ ] Task-level verification commands from the plan executed and passing
- [ ] Any convention violations fixed before moving to next task

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "placeholder", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in every step — if a step changes code, show the code
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD
- Every task must end with a coding-guideline follow-up checklist step
- Follow project coding conventions: `docs/coding-conventions.md`
- TypeScript/JavaScript naming: `PascalCase` types/classes, `camelCase` functions/variables, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants
- QML naming: `PascalCase` components and filenames, and `lowerCamelCase` properties, IDs, functions, and handlers
- Python naming: `snake_case` functions/variables, `UpperCamelCase` types, `_` prefix for private, and fully annotated functions

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at the spec with fresh eyes and check the plan against it. This is a checklist you run yourself — not a subagent dispatch.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.

**3. Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug.

If you find issues, fix them inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/agents/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (recommended)** - I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Inline Execution** - Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use skills:subagent-driven-development
- Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review

**If Inline Execution chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use skills:executing-plans
- Batch execution with checkpoints for review
